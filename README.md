# Number One Co-Pilot

Hello! Welcome to Number One Co-Pilot, an app built with Typescript and React. I created this app in order to assist passengers in keeping drivers awake and alert during long drives. This idea was born from the road trips my friends and I take every year and all of the different ways we keep each other awake.
